# Python Project - Cam H, Manyjote S, Jacob H 

## Planning:

Firstly we spent about 30 minutes planning what we were going to do. In our group of 3 we divided the work into two sections (Documentation and Development).
At the start Jacob and Cam worked on the code while Manjyote worked on the Docs. 
We decided to change the documentation to Jacob and Manjyote as this allowed greater and more detailed documentation as well as focussing on the marking criteria. Cam largely worked on the codebase with (minimal, lol) input from both Jacob and Manjyote.

To stay organised we used Trello to share our work between each other, and GitHub to for version management.

### Trello
We used Trello to organise and focus on the different aspects such as, testing, commands, use cases, user stories, etc. 
We also used it to divide tasks, and quantify who does what,

Instead of multiple email threads and loose papaer, we used Trello to make it more organised and complete our work in a more professional manner.

### GitHub

Github is being used for this project to keep code in one place, and allow others in this group to work on it in an effective manner, by using branches and merge requests. This keeps all our code seperate until it is reveiwed and changes are implemented. This keeps all the code backed up, and in one place to ensure everyone has the up-to-date application, and there is no confusion and to which files are the latest.

Git is also useful incase someone commits some bad code which breaks the application, a bug can be opened and assigned to people, or (what will probably happen) the code can be rolled back to th previous working commit.
