# Python Project - Cam H, Manyjote S, Jacob H 

## Planning:

Firstly we spent about 30 minutes planning what we were going to do. In our group of 3 we divided the work into two sections (Documentation and Development).
At the start Jacob and Cam worked on the code while Manjyote worked on the Docs. 
We decided to change the documentation to Jacob and Manjyote as this allowed greater and more detailed documentation as well as focussing on the marking criteria. Cam largely worked on the codebase with (minimal, lol) input from both Jacob and Manjyote.

To stay organised we used Trello to share our work between each other, and GitHub to for version management.

### Trello
We used Trello to organise and focus on the different aspects such as, testing, commands, use cases, user stories, etc. 
We also used it to divide tasks, and quantify who does what,

Instead of multiple email threads and loose papaer, we used Trello to make it more organised and complete our work in a more professional manner.

### GitHub

Github is being used for this project to keep code in one place, and allow others in this group to work on it in an effective manner, by using branches and merge requests. This keeps all our code seperate until it is reveiwed and changes are implemented. This keeps all the code backed up, and in one place to ensure everyone has the up-to-date application, and there is no confusion and to which files are the latest.

Git is also useful incase someone commits some bad code which breaks the application, a bug can be opened and assigned to people, or (what will probably happen) the code can be rolled back to th previous working commit.


### Actual documentation

Analysis and Design: 
User stories: 
1.	The placement of the ship is done by user.
2.	The actions are displayed on the screen.
3.	User can change orientation of ship (horizontal/vertical).
4.	User can change size of ship.
5.	A welcome screen is displayed on start up.
6.	User can place as many ships within valid coordinates as they want.
7.	The user has two ships to play the game.
8.	The user can enter commands on the command screen.
9.	An exit screen is displayed with a, ‘thank you’ message.
10.	 If the user enters an invalid command an error message is displayed.
11.	 If the user enters an invalid coordinate, or orientation an error message is displayed. 
12.	 Our user’s ships cover a minimum of 3 spaces in our grid. 
Design notes – there were more class uses than we originally thought. Adding to our classes of ship, grid, and our main file we now have sea…
Product backlog:
As we were working in a team we decided to divide the work up based on the guidelines given in the project so that none of us fell behind in our work for the project. 
Cameron largely worked on the code, and programming the battleship game. He was tasked with providing notes, and data for Manjyote and Jacob to add to the documentation. 
The documentation, as stated previously, was based off the data and code provided by Cameron. In order to make the project clear to our instructor we put effort into explaining the code, and making it concise. We also continuously checked the guidelines and our work to make sure we were on the right track and not wasting time. 

#### Testing:
place – Three arguments, orientation (horizontal or vertical), and coordinates are outputted.
show – Shows where the ships are placed on the grid (sea) and what orientation they are in.
exit – Exits to the console.
